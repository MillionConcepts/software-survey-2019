Planetary Science Software Survey
This survey is a component of research on planetary science professionals' use of data sources and software tools, especially Python tools. The survey is intended to be completely anonymous; please do not include individually identifying information in your responses. It is a community project with participants from organizations including the University of Colorado, USGS, Johns Hopkins University, the Naval Research Laboratory, Million Concepts, and OpenPlanetary.Your responses will provide valuable data for developers attempting to improve the community code base, and we deeply appreciate your time.

The next three questions ask you to describe difficulties you encounter with Python things that you frequently use in your scientific work. If you can only think of one or two Python things you encounter difficulties with, that's still useful.
Name of Python thing 1:
What deficiencies do you find in this thing?
Inadequate integration with other Python libraries and tools
Inadequate integration with non-Python software and data sources
Inability to handle data formats common in planetary science
Inability to interface with common planetary data sources
Poor performance
High learning curve or poor documentation
Generally bad user experience
